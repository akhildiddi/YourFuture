        ITI stands for Industrial Training Institute, which is a type of vocational education institute in India. These
        <br>
        institutes provide training in various industrial trades such as electrical, mechanical, electronics, and <br>
        welding, among others. The aim of these institutes is to provide practical and hands-on training to students in
        <br>
        the relevant trade so that they are equipped with the necessary skills to secure employment in their chosen <br>
        field. <br>
        The history of ITIs in India dates back to the 1950s when the government realized the need to provide practical
        <br>
        training to young people to help them secure employment in various industries. The first ITI was established in
        <br>
        1956 in Kolar Gold Fields, Karnataka, and since then, the network of ITIs has expanded rapidly across the <br>
        country. Today, there are over 15,000 ITIs in India, offering training to millions of students every year. <br>
        <br>
        The curriculum of ITIs is designed to align with the requirements of industries and is updated regularly to keep
        <br>
        pace with the changing job market. Additionally, the government has taken several initiatives to improve the
        <br>
        standard of ITIs and make them more accessible to students from all backgrounds. Despite these efforts, however,
        <br>
        the quality of training in ITIs remains inconsistent across different states and institutes. Nevertheless, ITIs
        <br>
        continue to play an important role in providing technical education and employment opportunities to young people
        <br>
        in India.
