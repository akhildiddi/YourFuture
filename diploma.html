            <p class="text-about-diploma">Diploma in Polytechnic is a three-year technical course offered in various
                fields of Engineering and Technology such as Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Science
                Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and others. The course provides students with practical, hands-on
                experience and prepares them for careers in their respective fields.

                The curriculum includes subjects like Applied Sciences, Basic Engineering, and Technology, Practical
                Workshops, and Project Works. Students also have the opportunity to undergo industrial training and gain
                real-world experience.

                Upon successful completion of the course, students are awarded a Diploma certificate, which is
                recognized by the government and industry alike. The diploma holders can work as technicians,
                supervisors, or junior engineers in various fields. Some students also opt for higher studies in their
                respective fields to advance their careers.

                In conclusion, a Diploma in Polytechnic provides students with a solid foundation in their chosen field
